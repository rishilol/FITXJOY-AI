# FITXJOY AI - Your Gentle Guide

A web application that provides personalized advice for self-improvement using AI and face recognition technology. Unlike traditional harsh methods, FITXJOY uses kindness and positivity to help users improve their lives.

## Features

- ðŸ¤– AI-powered personalized advice
- ðŸ‘¤ Face recognition for tailored recommendations
- ðŸŽ¯ Three modes of advice:
  - Looksmaxxing (facial features)
  - Dripmaxxing (clothing style)
  - Auramaxxing (overall presence)
- ðŸ’« Beautiful, serene UI with a peaceful design
- ðŸŒ¸ Responsive design for all devices

## Inspiration

The inspiration for FITXJOY came from observing how many self-improvement channels use negative reinforcement and harsh criticism to motivate people. We wanted to create a platform that proves positive reinforcement and gentle guidance can be just as effective, if not more so, in helping people improve themselves. The name FITXJOY represents our mission to combine fitness and self-improvement with joy and positivity.

## What it does

FITXJOY is an AI-powered platform that provides personalized advice for self-improvement in three key areas:

1. **Looksmaxxing**: Analyzes facial features and provides gentle suggestions for enhancing your natural beauty
2. **Dripmaxxing**: Offers personalized fashion advice to help you express your unique style
3. **Auramaxxing**: Provides holistic advice for improving your overall presence and confidence

The platform uses advanced face recognition technology to analyze user photos and combines this with Google's Gemini AI to generate personalized, positive advice. Unlike traditional self-improvement platforms that use harsh criticism, FITXJOY focuses on constructive, encouraging feedback that helps users feel good about themselves while working towards their goals.

## How we built it

FITXJOY was built using a modern tech stack:

- **Backend**: Python/Flask for the web server
